# AutoAccesses

This is an outdated Python Script using Selenium to run my day to day tasks back when I was working as an IT Support.

I have managed automate the most time consuming and annoying task, which is to create new accesses to onboard a new staff. To accompany this, there is also an access remover for when a staff leaves the company.
